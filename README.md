## BASIC PLAN
1. you wake up in a dark alley….
2. pick up item off the ground between three choices (wallet, lighter, onion, can also select nothing)
3. you exit the alleyway, and you see a big, green man in front of a doorway…
4. Bodyguard: who are you?
  you: enter your name (name = gets)
    if name == "farquaad" => shrek beats you up, game over
  bodyguard: how old are you?
  you: enter your age (age = gets)
    if age < 21 => "get out of here", game over
bodyguard: "can i see your id?"
you: playerchoice: "give item", "no" => if item == "" => game over || if item == "wallet" => present wallet || if item == "onion" => bribe bodyguard to be let in || if item == "lighter" => you wave lighter at bodyguard and fight ensues

fight sequence: 
1. shrek throws a left hook at you, what do you do?
  1. attempt to dodge, but because you're drunk - player gets hit and knocked out -- game over
  2. take the punch - shrek stops mid punch, respects it, and lets you in the bar
  3. block - you absorb the blow -- continue with sequence
2. Shrek is waiting for your next move
  1. bite - you immediately get a strong taste of onion in your mouth, causes you to retch, ending your night. game over
  2. seduce - you attempt to give your best one-liners to the bodyguard and it's successful. you wake up the next morning, having consumated your love-at-first-sight marriage. you win.
  3. throw a punch - in your drunken stupor, you throw a punch at the bodyguard. he is left stunned at how weak of a punch it was. mid-confusion, you decide to run into the bar. 

when inside the bar: 
you walk up to the bar, order a beer from the bartender, and sit on an empty stool. your night continues. GAME OGRE
